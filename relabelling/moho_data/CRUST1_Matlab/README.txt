The CRUST1.0 database has been reorganized into a matlab structure called C1 that has been saved
in a matlab data file called CRUST1.mat.   This file and two low-level access functions called
findCrust1cell.m and getCrust1.m comprise the contents of the folder CRUST1 which constitutes a 
matlab toolbox. This folder should be put with the userâ€™s other toolboxes, and it should be added
to the path using pathtool.m or addpath.m

An example script called queryCRUST1.m utilizes this toolbox. Normally this script would be placed
in a project folder rather than in the toolbox. When you run script queryCRUST1, it will to prompt
you to input the latitude (lat) and longitude (lon) of a point or station of interest, and then it
write out the vertical profile for with each CRUST1.0 cell or tile associated with the station.

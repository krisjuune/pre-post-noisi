# topography-transformation
projection of topography data with geographic coordinates onto a flat surface

# Overview

- [x] Transform to goecentric coordinates
- [x] Transform to spherical coordinate system
- 
- [ ] Check if transofrmation valid - transform back and plot both before and 'after after'  
- [ ] Rotate domain to be centred about the N pole (COULD ALSO BE 1st STEP)

## Step 1
Rotate domain (defined by geographic coordinates at the corners) to be centred at the North Pole (where lat = 90, lon = 0). 

## Step 2
Project topography data onto a flat surface. 

### Step 2.1 
Project the surface of the domain onto a flat surface. Each data point will still have the location 'attached' as latitude-longitude. The changing Earth's radius is/is not?? accounted for. 

Some sort of MatLab projection (map projection) function could be used for this.
### Step 2.2
The bathymetry data can now be generated by using the existing data (elevation with attached lat-lon) and the created plane surface.
